Just testing something with AWS Trusted Advisor

These access tokens won't work.
Just seeing if I can get alarms to trigger for `Exposed Access Keys` Trusted Advisor Check

## Key Info

Use this key:

Access key ID: `AKIAXSWPYG26Q46DMVV6`

With this Secret access key: `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`
